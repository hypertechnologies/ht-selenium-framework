WebDriver Wait

1. Hard Wait / Sleep
2. Implicit Wait
3. Explicit Wait
4. Fluent Wait


1. Hard Wait / Sleep: Waiting for fixed amount of time before you continue with next line of code.
2. Implicit Wait: It is used to tell the driver to wait for an element for certain amount of time
before it throws a "no such element" exception. Default time is 0. Once you define implicit wait,
it will be valid for life of the webdriver.
3. Explicit Wait: It is to tell the WebDriver to wait for certain condition to happen or maximum time exceeded
before giving "ElementNotVisible" exception.
4. Fluent Wait: It is to define maximum time for the webdriver to wait and as well as the frequency in which
we want to check the condition before it gives "ElementNotVisible" exception. It is used for elements that take
really long time to load.
